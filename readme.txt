## Intro
A simple php script (with Guzzle http and promise) to simulate:
1. Create a mailchimp list.
2. Add a new member to this list.
3. Update that member's status to 'unsubscribed'.

## Run
git clone this project.
php create_list_member_update.php
It will output the list id, member id and print out the member obj, after it is updated.

## /test directory
I play around some code there.
